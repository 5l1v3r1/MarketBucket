MarketBucket Flask Server

A web app that provides a single dashboard for online stores and sellers to interact with multiple online marketplaces. Products can be pushed at one go to all marketplaces and stocks sync across all marketplaces when an order is placed in any.

It was built using Python, Flask, Jinja and PostgreSQL.

(The backend server is hosted on Heroku and hence has a bit of a "cold start". Therefore, the very first request might take a couple of seconds to get a response as the server spins up. All subsequent requests should be at the expected high speed)
